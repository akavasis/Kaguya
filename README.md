# Kaguya
## Description
This is a hobby project using DirectX 12 and utilizing its latest features such as DirectX RayTracing (DXR). This project have evolved from a path tracer to a deferred renderer. See pathtracing branch for full details of the implementation (Path tracing is still supported in the main branch, just need to change a couple lines of code).

# Features
- __Path tracing__
- __Deferred rendering__
- __Bindless resource__
- __Multi-threaded commandlist recording__
- __Utilization of multiple queues on the GPU__
- __Lambertian, Glossy, Metal, Dielectric and standard PBR material models__
- __Post Processing on compute shaders__
- __Rectangular area light via linearly transformed cosines (LTC)__
- __Ray-traced soft shadows__
- __Shadow denoising via SVGF__

# Goals
- Experiment with DirectX 12 Ultimate features: DirectX Raytracing 1.1, Variable Rate Shading, Mesh Shaders, and Sampler Feedback
- Implement multiple anti-aliasing techniques
- Resume reading ray tracing books to implement a fully functional path tracer while maintaining the deferred renderer

# Build
- Visual Studio 2019
- Windows SDK Version 10.0.19041.0
- CMake Version 3.15
